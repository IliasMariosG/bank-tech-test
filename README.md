#**Bank Test Tech**#

## Outline ##

- During week 10 at Maker's we are asked to practice our OO design and TDD skills, starting off with a bank test tech.

## Approach ##

- I am using ruby and the program can be run on irb in the command line.
- Define two classes: > Bank_account & Account_statement
    The Bank_account class will include the methods that are necessary for deposits and withdrawal. Deposits and withdrawal are in turn necessary for the balance of the account at a certain instance of time.
